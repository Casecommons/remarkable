= Remarkable 3.0

Remarkable is a framework for rspec matchers that supports macros and I18n. It's
constituted of three pieces:

  + Remarkable: the framework with helpers, DSL, I18n and rspec features;

  + Remarkable ActiveRecord: a collection of matchers for ActiveRecord. It
    supports all ActiveRecord validations, associations and some extra matchers.

  + Remarkable Rails: a collection of matchers for ActionController. It also
    includes MacroStubs, which is a clean DSL for stubbing your controller methods.

In each folder above, you can find a README more detailed description of each piece.

== Install & Upgrade

Install the gem:

  sudo gem install remarkable_rails

This will install remarkable, remarkable_activerecord and remarkable_rails gems.

If you are developing matchers, for example hpricot matchers, you should install
only the remarkable "core" gem:

  sudo gem install remarkable

Users who are upgrading to Remarkable 3.0, should not find any problem if their
tests are running without deprecation warnings.
